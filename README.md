# CountLock V1

Phone-camera kit count verification, with Supabase persistence and Roboflow detection.

## What this does

An operator opens the app on a tablet/phone with a mounted camera, picks a project, picks a kit, places each part group under the camera, and taps **Picture**. CountLock detects the count, compares against the expected count from the project's CSV, and persists every capture as an immutable audit event. When the operator taps **Finished** the kit is locked. If counts don't match, a supervisor email is sent. Locked kits can be **Re-opened** for re-counting — but counts can only ever come from a camera capture, never from manual entry.

## Version 1 scope

Included:

1. CSV upload → project + kits in Supabase
2. Multi-project (every CSV is a new project, all listed on the home screen)
3. Three-button operator flow: Back · Picture · Finished
4. Camera capture → Roboflow detection → persisted count + immutable audit event
5. Lock kit on Finished, send supervisor email when mismatches or missing parts
6. **Re-open** a locked kit; re-captures append to the audit history rather than overwriting it
7. CSV export of project results
8. Per-org tenant isolation (UPI Manufacturing by default)

Architectural invariant — **counts are camera-only**:

- The frontend has no input field for count values. The only path that writes a count is the camera capture endpoint.
- The `count_events` audit table is enforced as append-only at the database level via a trigger. Every Picture tap is logged forever, even across re-opens.
- All writes go through Netlify functions using a Supabase service role key. The browser never holds the service role.

Not included yet:

1. Authenticated operator login
2. Epicor integration
3. Barcode scanning for kit selection
4. Part recognition (which part is on the mat)
5. Inventory deduction
6. Mixed part counting

## Architecture

```
Browser (operator UI)
    │   GET /api/projects, POST /api/projects, GET /api/projects?id=X
    │   POST /api/count-image     { kitId, partId, imageBase64 }
    │   POST /api/kits            { kitId, action: "finish" | "reopen" }
    ▼
Netlify Functions
    │   service-role Supabase client + Roboflow + Resend
    ▼
Supabase (countlock schema)
    projects → project_parts
            → kits → kit_counts          (current, mutable)
                  → count_events          (append-only, trigger-enforced)
```

## CSV format

```csv
part,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Review
expected #,3,6,3,6,7,8,3,6,7,33,
Kit 1,,,,,,,,,,,
Kit 2,,,,,,,,,,,
```

Rules:

1. First row has numbered columns (the part-group sequence).
2. Second row starts with `expected #` and contains the target count for each column.
3. Each remaining row is a kit name.
4. Numbered columns represent the count-sequence, not part numbers (yet).
5. The kit row data cells are populated by CountLock as captures happen.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill in SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY, COUNTLOCK_ORG_ID
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:8888 (Netlify Dev proxies Vite + functions).

### Required env vars

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | From Supabase → Settings → API |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Service role key (server-only — never bundle into the frontend) |
| `COUNTLOCK_ORG_ID` | UUID of `public.orgs.id`. Default = UPI Manufacturing. |
| `MOCK_COUNT` | `true` to skip Roboflow and return random counts (for UI testing) |
| `ROBOFLOW_MODEL_URL` | e.g. `https://detect.roboflow.com/YOUR_PROJECT/YOUR_VERSION` |
| `ROBOFLOW_API_KEY` | Roboflow API key |
| `COUNT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | Default `0.65` — predictions below this are dropped |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Resend API key |
| `SUPERVISOR_EMAIL` | Recipient for review emails |
| `FROM_EMAIL` | e.g. `CountLock <countlock@yourdomain.com>` |

### Roboflow setup

For local UI testing, leave `MOCK_COUNT=true`. The count-image function returns a random count between 1 and 10 with confidence 0.99.

For real detection:

```text
MOCK_COUNT=false
ROBOFLOW_MODEL_URL=https://detect.roboflow.com/YOUR_PROJECT/YOUR_VERSION
ROBOFLOW_API_KEY=...
COUNT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.65
```

The Roboflow model must be an object-detection model that draws one bounding box per visible part. The function counts predictions above the confidence threshold.

## Re-open semantics

A locked kit can be re-opened from the operator screen. On re-open:

- `kits.status` flips back to `open`
- `kits.reopened_at` is set to now
- `kits.reopen_count` increments
- Existing kit counts are **preserved** (the operator sees what was previously detected)
- Tapping Picture for any part overwrites the row in `kit_counts` and appends a new row to `count_events`
- Tapping Finished re-locks the kit and re-runs the supervisor-email logic

This means the audit log in `count_events` is the authoritative history of every capture, regardless of how many times the kit was re-opened.

## Supabase schema

```
countlock.projects        (id, org_id → public.orgs, name, csv_filename, created_at)
countlock.project_parts   (project_id, part_id, position, expected)
countlock.kits            (id, project_id, name, status, locked_at, reopened_at, reopen_count, review_note)
countlock.kit_counts      (kit_id, part_id, count, confidence, mode, counted_at)  — current state
countlock.count_events    (kit_id, part_id, count, confidence, mode, predictions, created_at)  — append-only
```

### Audit log immutability

`count_events` has a trigger that blocks `UPDATE` and `DELETE`. Explicit archive operations (when a project is intentionally being purged) require setting a session-level escape hatch:

```sql
set local countlock.allow_archive = 'on';
delete from countlock.count_events where ...;
```

The foreign key from `count_events.kit_id` to `kits.id` is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, so projects with audit history cannot be hard-deleted by accident.

### RLS

Tables in `countlock.*` have RLS enabled. Authenticated users (when login is added) can `SELECT` rows belonging to their org via membership in `public.org_members`. There are no `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` policies — only the service role (used by Netlify functions) can write. This is the architectural enforcement that counts only come from the camera pipeline.

## Operator rules

1. One part group at a time.
2. No overlapping pieces.
3. Use a high-contrast counting mat.
4. Fixed phone mount.
5. Tap **Picture** only after parts are spread out.
6. Tap **Finished** only after every part group has been captured.
7. If a count keeps failing, notify the supervisor.

## Deploy to Netlify

1. Push this folder to GitHub.
2. Create a Netlify site from the repo.
3. Add the env vars from `.env.example`.
4. Deploy.

## Test

```bash
npm test
```

Runs CSV parsing tests against the shared `_csv.js` module.
